# Shuffling-of-the-pack-of-cards
Create a pack of playing cards. Simulate shuffling of the pack and display the shuffled cards. Propose two new games with cards. Implement the following using an array of structures.

This is the algorithm which helps to shuffle a deck of 52 cards and displays 11 cards for each player. 
This game can display a set of 13 cards for 2 to 4 players. This algorithm also includes two playable games
The problem can be solved by using srand() and rand () pre-defined functions which help us to pick a random number from the array. Which helps to choose the card

Shuffling of Cards 
This part takes the array of cards and by using srand and rand which are predefined functions used to pick an integer randomly we shuffle the cards in the array and use them to play various games.
Game 1
This is a game in which the computer displays 5 cards from the shuffled array and holds one of them as the answer and asks the user for an input. If the choice of yours is the same as the choice of computer then you win or else you lose.
Game 2
This is a game in which the computer gives you a pack of 13 cards randomly from the deck and our aim is to swap our cards with the remaining cards until your pack has all the cards of the same color. The person who has the cards with the same color first wins the game.
